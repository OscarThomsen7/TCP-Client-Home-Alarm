A TCP client that connects to a friends TCP server that runs on a Pi Pico. Extremely basic HTML to be able to activate and deactivate the alarm through a browser.
The client sends a 1 to the server when the 'Activate' button is clicked, this activates the alarm. Same thing happens when 'Deactivate' is clicked but a 0 is sent.

If the alarm is tripped the client will send a notification to my friend who is using the alarm.
